Now here is my advice. I don’t know how long civilization or humanity have, or
how exactly this will end, but I can see the ship going down with the next few
years or decades. We are beyond screwed. The first step is to accept this
reality. You may feel terrorized by this, you may feel numb, powerless, and
it’s a completely normal reaction to have, many have gone through this in this
space. Then it’s up to you to decide what you want to do with the time you have
left. I would personally recommend not having kids, preparing at least a
little, both physically (storing food, water, etc.) and mentally, not working
too hard, and just doing what you enjoy most while you can.
