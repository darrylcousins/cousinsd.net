## Introduction

I was born in Aotearoa the year CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheric concentrations
reached 320.96ppm, up from the around 280ppm that had been in balance for
thousands of years. CO<sub>2</sub> has now reached 417.31ppm<sup>1</sup>, time
is running out.

M. and I live in a 100m<sup>2</sup> house on a ¼ acre section in a small rural
town south of Ōtautahi. M. works on an organic vegetable farm and I pick up
work here and there, though most of my time is my own and I have plenty to do.

I'm anxious about the climate crisis, mass extinction, and the extremism of the
political right.
